# SafeAgentBench: A Benchmark for Safe Task Planning of Embodied LLM Agents

With the integration of large language models (LLMs), embodied agents have strong capabilities to execute complicated instructions in natural language, paving a way for the potential deployment of embodied robots. However, a foreseeable issue is that those embodied agents can also flawlessly execute some hazardous tasks, potentially causing damages in real world. To study this issue, we present **SafeAgentBench** —- a new benchmark for safety-aware task planning of embodied LLM agents. SafeAgentBench includes: (1) a new dataset with 750 tasks, covering 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2) SafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller, supporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 8 state-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that the best-performing baseline gets 69% success rate for safe tasks, but only 5% rejection rate for hazardous tasks, indicating significant safety risks.

## Quickstart

Clone repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/shengyin/safeagentbench.git 
$ cd safeagentbench
```

Install requirements:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## This Fork

This fork is tuned for running SafeAgentBench locally with AI2-THOR and includes a practical, end-to-end execution path.

- **AI2-THOR execution test harness**: `methods/vision_eval.py` loads a dataset JSONL, calls the vision planner in `methods/map_vlm.py`, converts high-level plans to low-level actions, and executes them via `low_level_controller/`.
- **Optional execution/LLM scoring**: the runner computes execution success (object-state) and can optionally run LLM-based evaluation.
- **Architecture references**: see `ARCHITECTURE.md` and the rendered diagram for the execution/evaluation flow.

## AI2-THOR Testing (Updated Usage)

Set your API key and run a small local test:

```bash
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
$ export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini        # LLM eval model
$ export OPENAI_VISION_MODEL=gpt-4o      # vision planning model

$ python methods/vision_eval.py \
  --dataset dataset/safe_detailed_1009.jsonl \
  --num 1 \
  --start 0 \
  --headless \
  --out runs.jsonl \
  --verbose
```

Notes:
- `--headless` is recommended for servers or CI; omit it to render a window locally.
- `--skip-llm-eval` disables the LLM evaluation stage (planning still uses the vision model).
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` can be set for OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
- The dataset JSONL is expected to contain `scene_name` and `instruction`, and may include `final_state` and `step` for evaluation.

## More Info 

- [**Dataset**](dataset/): Safe detailed tasks(300 samples), unsafe detailed tasks(300 samples), abstract tasks(100 samples) and long-horizon tasks(50 samples).
- [**Evaluators**](evaluator/): Evaluation metrics for each type of task, including success rate, rejection rate, and other metrics.
- [**low-level controller**](low_level_controller/): A low-level controller for SafeAgentEnv, which takes in the high-level action and map them to low-level actions supported by AI2-THOR for the agent to execute. You can choose multi-agent version or single-agent version. 
- [**Methods**](methods/): Implementation of the proposed methods.

## SOTA Embodied LLM Agents

Because each agent has different code structure, we can not provide all the implementation codes. You can refer to these works' papers and codes to implement your own agent.
